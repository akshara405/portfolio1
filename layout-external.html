        <h1>ABOUT ME </h1>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Akshara Soni, a 20-year-old designer and artist with a deep passion for creating meaningful, visually captivating art.
            <br><br>
            My journey into painting began at a young age, and over the years, my love for art has evolved into a lifelong pursuit. 
            
            During the pandemic, I found myself completely immersed in my craft, often spending 8-10 hours painting without ever losing interest. 
            
            This dedication has shaped my approach to art, where I focus on intricate details, pouring love and effort into each piece.
            <br><br>
            Initially, I found joy in painting sunsets, drawn to the beauty of the skies and the freedom of creating them. However, over time, my style has evolved, especially as I embraced the rich cultural heritage of Rajasthan. 
           
            Growing up in this vibrant region, I became inspired by the ornate jharokas, intricate designs, and the stunning color palettes that define Rajasthani art. 
            
            Today, I draw on these traditional influences, but I am also excited to continue exploring the essence of miniature art in my paintings. 
            
            I aim to incorporate its delicate precision and intricate detailing, blending its timeless beauty with my contemporary artistic vision. 
            Every piece I create is a reflection of my passion, my heritage, and my ongoing evolution as an artist.

            <h2>EVOLVING AS AN ARTIST</h2> 
            <p>
                As an artist, my aim is not only to master the delicate craft of miniature art on paper and canvas but to expand its reach into a variety of mediums and spaces. 
                I envision my work being featured on diverse surfaces—from clothing and accessories to tableware used in hotels and resorts, where my designs could enhance the dining experience. 
                The thought of seeing my art come to life in these everyday contexts, whether as part of a guest’s experience or as an exquisite piece of decor, is incredibly fulfilling. 
                There's a unique sense of pride and gratitude that comes from knowing your creations are being appreciated and used by others. 
                <br><br>
                To me, this is the ultimate expression of art—transforming spaces and elevating ordinary objects into personalized, meaningful works of beauty. 
                I am driven by the idea of making my art accessible and impactful in various forms, creating a lasting connection with those who encounter it. 
                This expansive vision for miniature art is my path forward, and I am excited to see where it leads.

            <h2>MY VISION</h2>
            <p>
                As I continue to evolve as an artist, I aspire to bring my vision to life by collaborating with local craftsmen, block printers, and fellow art lovers to create a unique store that showcases my miniature art in diverse forms. 
                My goal is to create a space where my artwork can be found on a variety of items, such as Indian ethnic wear, handcrafted letters, fridge magnets, plates, spoons, hankies, cups, and ceramic pieces. 
                By partnering with skilled artisans, I hope to combine traditional craftsmanship with my own artistic expression, resulting in a collection of functional and decorative pieces that celebrate both art and culture. 
                <br><br>
                The store will also feature a dedicated gallery of my paintings where visitors can enjoy and purchase my artwork, making it accessible to art lovers and collectors alike. 
                To further nurture the love for miniature art, I envision hosting workshops in the space, offering classes on pottery, clay art, and miniature painting. 
                These workshops will provide an opportunity to share my passion with others, teaching them the intricate techniques of miniature art and helping to spread its beauty and history to a wider audience.
